## docker-than-light Controller

This project provides a simple docker experimental proxy container for the docker-than-light project

This allows us to use a container to execute commands against the docker network plugins from a remote endpoint, using the standard non-experimental docker apis.

The image for this repo is available as `bfosberry/docker-than-light-controller` on dockerhub.
